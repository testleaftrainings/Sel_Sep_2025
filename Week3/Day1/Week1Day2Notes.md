### Arrays:
1. **Definition:**
   An array in Java is a data structure that stores a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays provide a convenient way to group related data items under a single name. The elements in an array are accessed using an index, starting from 0. Arrays are useful for efficiently managing and manipulating large sets of data.

2. **Explanation:**
  *Declaration:*
    Arrays are declared with a type, followed by square brackets ([]).
    Example: int[] numbers;
  *Initialization:*
    Arrays can be initialized when declared or later using the new keyword.
    Example: int[] numbers = new int[5];
  *Accessing Elements:*
   Elements in an array are accessed using their index (starting from 0).
   Example: int firstNumber = numbers[0];
  *Length of Array:*
   The length of an array is obtained using the length attribute.
   Example: int arrayLength = numbers.length;
